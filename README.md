# Apple Website with Three.js, GSAP, React, and Sentry

This project is a recreation of an Apple website, featuring the iPhone 15 Pro page with advanced animations and interactivity. It leverages a combination of modern web technologies and tools to deliver a high-quality user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for efficient development.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser, used for rendering the iPhone 15 Pro model and particle effects.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A robust animation library for smooth and creative animations, enhancing the "Titanium" text and device transitions.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Core scripting language for logic and interactivity.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for layout and design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Sentry**: An error tracking and performance monitoring tool integrated to track the development progress and production issues.

## Setup
This template provides a minimal setup to get the project running with Vite and the mentioned technologies.

### Official Plugins
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Project Features
- 3D rendering of the iPhone 15 Pro using Three.js.
- Animated "Titanium" text effect with GSAP.
- Responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.
- Real-time error tracking and performance monitoring with Sentry.
- Smooth transitions and interactivity using React and custom JavaScript.

## Expanding the Project
If you are developing this further for a production application, we recommend:
- **TypeScript**: Integrate TypeScript for type safety. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to add TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).
- **Enhanced Sentry Configuration**: Add release tracking and performance monitoring for better insights.
- **Optimization**: Optimize Three.js performance and GSAP animations for scalability.
